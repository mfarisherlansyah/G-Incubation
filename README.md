# City Bike Trip Data Analysis
A repository containing practices I learned during the G-Incubation online classes.

The practice used the data from [Citi Bike System Data](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data).

This sample project has the purpose to analyze the bike trips data and to build a model that has the ability to recognize whether a particular trip belongs to a particular user type (there are two types: customers and subscribers).
